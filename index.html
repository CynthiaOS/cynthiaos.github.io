            <h2>What's CynthiaOS?</h2>
        </center>
        <p><strong>CynthiaOS</strong> is an attempt to build a fast, secure, light-weight and efficient Unix-like operating system by this <a href="https://twitter.com/mufeedvh" target="_noblank">kiddo</a>.</p>

        <p>The name was just a random one I thought was catchy and later found out that it's a Greek origin name that meant "from Mount Cynthus", cool I guess.</p>

        <p>I am doing this in order to learn about the core concepts of Computer Science and it's implementation. I started this out of curiosity and it occured to me that building an Operating System from scrath would be a great idea even though I know nothing about it.</p>

        <p>This operating system will be focused on <strong>security</strong>, <strong>fastness</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong> as it's top priority. As a security researcher myself, I am hoping to learn about low-level vulnerabilities, OS privilege escalations, etc throughout my journey of making this operating system.</p>

        <p>I am planning to write this OS in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_noblank">Rust Programming Language</a> which is faster, safer, high-performant, and efficient than C++.</p>

        <!-- release when -->

            <h2>Release When?</h2>
        </center>
        <p>Not in the near future, I am doing this in my spare time so it will take a while for a complete release although you can see the journey on the <a href="https://github.com/CynthiaOS" target="_noblank">CynthiaOS GitHub Organization</a> and I will occasionaly write updates on this <a href="/blog/" target="_noblank">blog</a>.</p>

        <!-- my plans -->
        <center>
            <h2>My Plans</h2>
        </center>
        <p>I am thinking about a lot of ideas and as a single person, I don't think I can implement them all but with the contributions from open-source, it would be really easy. I have plans to build a <strong>CynthiaSDK</strong> for developing apps specifically for CynthiaOS and <strong>Windows</strong>/<strong>Linux</strong> application support by default which I don't even know is possible but I am thinking <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_noblank"><strong>wine</strong></a>, <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_noblank"><strong>Lutris</strong></a>, <strong>subsystems</strong> and all that.</p>

        <p>And to support games and GPU usage applications, I have to write GPU drivers and stuff, this will be exciting! I don't even know if I will complete this or if I just procrastinate and forget about this. I really want to release this and make it a <strong>daily usable</strong> operating system just like the one you're using right now except if you're "that" guy.</p>
